The custom and protocol for gift giving among Native Americans was that all gifts had to be equivalent in status and value. The fact that the Cheyennes gave brass kettles to the Kiowas meant that brass kettles were considered to carry the highest status; that of the equivalent to horses and guns.\n\nCitation: From George Bird Grinnell, The Cheyenne Indians, Volume 2: War, Ceremonies and Religion.

As noted on the wooden box, this lamp was advertised and sold as a camp lamp for sportsmen. It would appear that Justrite didn't limit their products to any one market sector. Over the history of Justrite production from 1912 to 1931, Justrite used at least 154 different lamp model numbers and at least 246 part numbers for a total of at least 400 number identifications. It is very clear that Justrite provided more carbide lamps over a longer period of time than any other U.S. manufacturer.\n\nSuggested Use: Use as an example of the multiple uses of carbide lamps. Miners, though important users, were not the only people to employ carbide lamps to see in the dark.\n\nCitation: “The Justrite No. 100 with Spare Bottom and Box”. circa 1912.

    "description": "This is a photograph from 1909 of a boy surrounded by his toys on the front porch. His toys are carefully arranged. They are numerous. It can be assumed that his family possesses great material resources in order to have accumulated these items.\n\nSpecial attention should be given to the toys and their order on the stairs. Are those closest to him the “revered” toys? What about the ones far away? Also, how many of these toys would be available today in their modern counterparts?\n\nCitation: “Boy and Toys”.

Lazarus Ercker was a German metallurgist. He was the chief assayer of Dresden in Saxony. In 1567 he was appointed chief tester of coins for the state of Bohemia. This was an important position as he not only declared which coins were legal and which were counterfeit, but he also established the value of the coins. In 1574 he wrote his great work that described the first systematic review of the methods and techniques for testing alloys of precious metals. It was the first manual of analytic and metallurgical chemistry.\n\nFrom: Lazarus Ercker von Schreckenfels, Treatise an the Foremost Mineralogy and Metallurgy, LST4.",

Mr. Thomas's grammar is very poor, but his methods were accurate.\nSPECIAL ATTENTION: Mr. Thomas mentions that he had two \\\"rights\\\": a homestead right and a timber right. The homestead right came from the Homestead Act of 1862 and allowed 160 acres free if the person who filed the claim live on and improved the land for five years. The timber right came from the Timber Act of 1873 and allowed another 160 acres to be added to a homestead claim if the person planted trees on the property.
